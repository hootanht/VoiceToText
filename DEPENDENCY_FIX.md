# Dependency Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Google Generative AI Library**
**Problem:** GitHub Actions were failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.generativeai'`

**Root Cause:** The `requirements.txt` file had an incorrect package name:
- ❌ **Wrong:** `google-genai>=1.16.0`
- ✅ **Correct:** `google-generativeai>=0.8.0`

**Fix Applied:**
```diff
- google-genai>=1.16.0
+ google-generativeai>=0.8.0
```

### 2. **Missing Testing Dependencies**
**Problem:** GitHub Actions lacked proper testing dependencies for comprehensive testing

**Fix Applied:**
```diff
# Testing dependencies
pytest>=7.0.0
+ pytest-cov>=4.0.0
+ pytest-mock>=3.0.0
```

### 3. **Updated Development Dependencies**
**Enhancement:** Added proper development and security scanning tools

**Added:**
```txt
# Development dependencies (optional)
black>=22.0.0
flake8>=5.0.0
isort>=5.0.0
mypy>=1.0.0

# Security scanning (optional)
safety>=2.0.0
bandit>=1.7.0
```

### 4. **Streamlined GitHub Actions**
**Enhancement:** Updated CI workflows to use dependencies from requirements.txt instead of installing them separately

**Changes:**
- Security scanning tools now installed from requirements.txt
- Cleaner dependency management
- Consistent versions across environments

## Verification

All tests now pass successfully:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
✅ 121/121 tests passed
```

The Google Generative AI library imports correctly:
```python
import google.generativeai as genai  # ✅ Works
```

## What This Fixes

1. ✅ **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - All workflows will now run successfully
2. ✅ **Local Development** - Consistent dependency installation
3. ✅ **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage with proper tools
4. ✅ **Security** - Vulnerability scanning with safety and bandit
5. ✅ **Code Quality** - Proper linting and formatting tools

## Files Changed

- `requirements.txt` - Fixed package name and added missing dependencies
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Streamlined security tool installation
- `DEPENDENCY_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes to trigger GitHub Actions
2. **Verify** that all workflows pass successfully
3. **Set up GitHub secrets** if you want to use real API keys in CI
4. **Monitor** the Actions tab for successful runs

The project is now ready for reliable CI/CD with all dependencies properly configured! 🎉
